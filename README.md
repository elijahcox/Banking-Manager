# Banking-Manager

This is a banking manager I created to demonstrate my object oriented programming knowledge. Paired with the Python Tkinter GUI package, it allows for easy creation and management of simple bank accounts. I plan on extending its functionality by incorporating an SQL database inorder to implement data redundancy.
